Got it 👍 To populate your 4 dashboard cards (Total Meetings, Upcoming Meetings, Missed Meetings, and History), you’ll need a stored procedure that returns all four counts in a single result set.

Let’s assume your meeting table is called tbl_Meetings with at least these columns:

MeetingID (PK)

MeetingDate (datetime)

Status (optional, could be "Completed", "Cancelled", etc.)


Here’s a sample SQL Server stored procedure:

CREATE PROCEDURE sp_GetMeetingCounts
AS
BEGIN
    SET NOCOUNT ON;

    SELECT 
        -- Total number of meetings
        (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tbl_Meetings) AS TotalMeetings,

        -- Meetings scheduled in the future
        (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tbl_Meetings 
         WHERE MeetingDate > GETDATE()) AS UpcomingMeetings,

        -- Meetings scheduled in the past but not attended/missed
        (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tbl_Meetings 
         WHERE MeetingDate < GETDATE()
           AND Status = 'Missed') AS MissedMeetings,

        -- Meetings already completed (History)
        (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tbl_Meetings 
         WHERE MeetingDate < GETDATE()
           AND Status = 'Completed') AS HistoryMeetings;
END

🔹 How it works:

TotalMeetings → All meetings in the table.

UpcomingMeetings → Where MeetingDate is greater than today.

MissedMeetings → Where MeetingDate has passed and Status = 'Missed'.

HistoryMeetings → Where MeetingDate has passed and Status = 'Completed'.

👉 Question for you:
Does your tbl_Meetings table already have a Status column (like Completed, Missed, Cancelled), or should I base the logic only on MeetingDate?
