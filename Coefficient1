Here’s a structured Operation Change Proposal draft based on your idea using WinActor for SAP automation:


---

Operation Change Proposal

Title: Automation of SAP Coefficient Value Input and Prooflist Notification using WinActor


---

1. Background / Current Issues

Currently, the process of inputting coefficient values into SAP is performed manually by operators. This manual method often results in the following challenges:

Human Error: Mistyped or missed values during SAP entry.

Time-Consuming: Manual input takes significant effort for repetitive data sets.

Lack of Proof: No automatic generation of reference proof for validation.

Delayed Notifications: Stakeholders are not immediately informed of updates.



---

2. Proposed Change in Operation

The proposal introduces WinActor RPA (Robotic Process Automation) to automate the coefficient value entry and prooflist notification. The new operation will:

1. Read Coefficient Value Template – WinActor will extract the coefficient values from a standardized Excel template.


2. Automated SAP Input – WinActor will log into SAP and input the values directly into the required fields.


3. Generate Prooflist – After input, WinActor will take screenshots of the updated entries as proof.


4. Email Notification – WinActor will automatically compile the prooflist (screenshots) and send it via email to designated recipients for tracking and validation.




---

3. Operation Flow (New Process)

Step 1 – Data Preparation:

Operator prepares coefficient values in a pre-approved template (Excel/CSV).


Step 2 – RPA Execution:

Operator runs the WinActor bot.

WinActor reads the template and launches SAP.


Step 3 – Automated SAP Input:

Bot navigates SAP menus and inputs values into correct fields.


Step 4 – Prooflist Creation:

Bot captures screenshots of completed entries as evidence.

Screenshots are stored in a designated folder.


Step 5 – Email Notification:

Bot attaches prooflist screenshots to an auto-generated email.

Email is sent to responsible team/stakeholders for confirmation of update.



---

4. Detailed Changes in Operation and System

Operational Changes:

Before: Manual entry of coefficient values by operators.

After: Automated entry by WinActor bot.

Before: No structured proof of updates.

After: Screenshots stored and emailed automatically as prooflist.

Before: Delayed communication to stakeholders.

After: Instant email notification upon update.


System Changes:

Integration of WinActor RPA:

Script to read coefficient template.

SAP navigation sequence automation.

Screenshot capture and storage.

Email sending module (Outlook/SMTP integration).


Template Standardization:

Coefficient values must be maintained in a consistent format (Excel).

Ensures WinActor bot can parse correctly.




---

5. Benefits of the New Operation

Accuracy: Reduces human error during SAP data entry.

Efficiency: Speeds up processing time for coefficient updates.

Traceability: Prooflist ensures updates can be verified anytime.

Transparency: Automatic notifications improve awareness and accountability.

Scalability: Same automation can be extended to other SAP transactions.

✅ Highlighted Change in Operation:
Manual data entry and validation → Automated SAP input with prooflist and email notification using WinActor.

DR2
Develop a centralized program to execute scenarios in WinActor.

Background:
On a quarterly schedule OHG Coefficient is being inputted in GNS+ by Procurement members. The reference value is being provided by Business control based on Accounting calculation result for each EPPI cost center. Accuracy of the inputted data is of the essence for this process since it will affect the pricing of EPPI finished goods. On this process the only role of Procurement is just to input value and make sure the correctness of the inputted value.


Manual verification of inputted data
