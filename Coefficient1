Here’s a structured Operation Change Proposal draft based on your idea using WinActor for SAP automation:


---

Operation Change Proposal

Title: Automation of SAP Coefficient Value Input and Prooflist Notification using WinActor


---

1. Background / Current Issues

Currently, the process of inputting coefficient values into SAP is performed manually by operators. This manual method often results in the following challenges:

Human Error: Mistyped or missed values during SAP entry.

Time-Consuming: Manual input takes significant effort for repetitive data sets.

Lack of Proof: No automatic generation of reference proof for validation.

Delayed Notifications: Stakeholders are not immediately informed of updates.



---

2. Proposed Change in Operation

The proposal introduces WinActor RPA (Robotic Process Automation) to automate the coefficient value entry and prooflist notification. The new operation will:

1. Read Coefficient Value Template – WinActor will extract the coefficient values from a standardized Excel template.


2. Automated SAP Input – WinActor will log into SAP and input the values directly into the required fields.


3. Generate Prooflist – After input, WinActor will take screenshots of the updated entries as proof.


4. Email Notification – WinActor will automatically compile the prooflist (screenshots) and send it via email to designated recipients for tracking and validation.

3. Operation Flow (New Process)

Step 1 – Data Preparation:

Operator prepares coefficient values in a pre-approved template (Excel/CSV).


Step 2 – RPA Execution:

Operator runs the WinActor bot.

WinActor reads the template and launches SAP.


Step 3 – Automated SAP Input:

Bot navigates SAP menus and inputs values into correct fields.


Step 4 – Prooflist Creation:

Bot captures screenshots of completed entries as evidence.

Screenshots are stored in a designated folder.


Step 5 – Email Notification:

Bot attaches prooflist screenshots to an auto-generated email.

Email is sent to responsible team/stakeholders for confirmation of update.

4. Detailed Changes in Operation and System

Operational Changes:

Before: Manual entry of coefficient values by operators.

After: Automated entry by WinActor bot.

Before: No structured proof of updates.

After: Screenshots stored and emailed automatically as prooflist.

Before: Delayed communication to stakeholders.

After: Instant email notification upon update.


System Changes:

Integration of WinActor RPA:

Script to read coefficient template.

SAP navigation sequence automation.

Screenshot capture and storage.

Email sending module (Outlook/SMTP integration).


Template Standardization:

Coefficient values must be maintained in a consistent format (Excel).

Ensures WinActor bot can parse correctly.




---

5. Benefits of the New Operation

Accuracy: Reduces human error during SAP data entry.

Efficiency: Speeds up processing time for coefficient updates.

Traceability: Prooflist ensures updates can be verified anytime.

Transparency: Automatic notifications improve awareness and accountability.

Scalability: Same automation can be extended to other SAP transactions.

✅ Highlighted Change in Operation:
Manual data entry and validation → Automated SAP input with prooflist and email notification using WinActor.
