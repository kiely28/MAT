Got it üëç You want a VBA macro that will automatically open your Downloads folder, look for today‚Äôs file with a name like:

message_latency YYYY-MM-DD.csv

and then open it in Excel.

Here‚Äôs the macro code for you:

Sub OpenTodayLatencyFile()
    Dim todayDate As String
    Dim filePath As String
    Dim downloadsPath As String
    
    ' Get today's date in the required format (YYYY-MM-DD)
    todayDate = Format(Date, "yyyy-mm-dd")
    
    ' Path to the Downloads folder
    downloadsPath = Environ("USERPROFILE") & "\Downloads\"
    
    ' Construct full file path
    filePath = downloadsPath & "message_latency " & todayDate & ".csv"
    
    ' Check if file exists
    If Dir(filePath) <> "" Then
        Workbooks.Open Filename:=filePath
    Else
        MsgBox "File not found: " & vbCrLf & filePath, vbExclamation, "File Missing"
    End If
End Sub

üîπ How it works

1. Gets today‚Äôs date and formats it as 2025-10-03.


2. Builds the full file path inside your Downloads folder.


3. Opens the file if it exists; otherwise, shows a warning.



üëâ Do you want me to also make it automatically open yesterday‚Äôs file if today‚Äôs isn‚Äôt available?
