Background:
     The current stocktaking process performed on manual operations within the SAP GUI, requiring the system master team to navigate multiple transactions, extract raw data, and format reports manually. This approach is time-consuming and prone to human error, particularly during peak inventory periods. Repetitive tasks and complex reporting requirements further contribute to inefficiencies and delays in report generation.

     To address these challenges, we propose the development of Excel VBA macro functions that automate SAP GUI scripting for stocktaking activities. These macros will improve data extraction, standardize report formatting, and enable the automatic generation of key reports, including:
Stocktaking Inventory Result
Stocktaking Summary Report per Plant
Difference  Posting Check
Stocktaking Summary Report per Section in charge

This automation aims to reduce manual workload, improve data accuracy, and ensure the timely delivery of reports. It will also provide section in-charges with clearer insights into discrepancies and posting validations, thereby strengthening inventory control and enhancing audit readiness.
