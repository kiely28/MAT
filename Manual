Nice — here’s a single, clean step-by-step user manual that walks a user through the whole flow: Login → Dashboard → Meetings List → Meeting Attendance → View Attendees / View Meeting Details. I kept each task short and actionable so you can copy/paste into a help page or print it.

Login (Access the system)

1. Open your browser and navigate to the app URL (example: https://yourserver/login.aspx).


2. On the Login card:

1. Enter your Username.


2. Enter your Password (characters are hidden while typing).


3. (Optional) Click Forgot password? if you need to reset your password.


4. Click Log in.




3. Expected result:

If credentials are valid → you are redirected to the Dashboard.

If invalid → an error message appears (e.g., “Invalid username or password”). Re-enter details or request help from admin.




Dashboard (Summary & navigation)

1. Purpose: quick overview of meetings and their statuses.


2. What you see:

Top navigation: Dashboard, Meetings, System Maintenance, user icon.

Summary cards: Upcoming, Ongoing, Missed, Completed (each shows a count and a View Details link).



3. How to use:

1. Click a summary card’s View Details to open a filtered meetings list for that status.


2. Click Dashboard at any time to return here.




4. Expected result:

Clicking a card or View Details leads to the Meetings page filtered by that status.




Meetings List (view, create, edit, delete)

1. Access: Click Meetings in the top navigation.


2. Page elements:

+ Create New Meeting button (top-left).

Table columns: #, Meeting ID, Title, Start Date, End Date, Venue, Status, Actions (eye/edit/trash icons).



3. Create a new meeting:

1. Click + Create New Meeting.


2. Fill in required fields: Title, Start Date/Time, End Date/Time, Venue, (optional) participant list or notes.


3. Click Save or Create.


4. Expected: system generates a unique Meeting ID and the new meeting appears in the list with status Scheduled.




4. View meeting details:

1. In the table, click the eye icon (View).


2. Expected: opens meeting details page (meeting title, schedule, venue, description, attendees).




5. Edit a meeting:

1. Click the pencil icon.


2. Update fields as needed.


3. Click Save.


4. Note: editing ongoing meetings should be limited—avoid changing start time while session is active.




6. Delete a meeting:

1. Click the trash icon.


2. Confirm the deletion when prompted.


3. Warning: deletion is permanent (unless system implements a soft-delete).




7. Expected behavior & tips:

Status automatically changes depending on current time (Scheduled → Ongoing → Completed) or admin actions (End Meeting).

If you can’t see Create/Edit/Delete options, you likely lack necessary permissions (contact admin).




Meeting Attendance (tap IN / OUT)

1. Access:

From Meetings List, click the eye icon on a meeting, then click Open or the Meeting Attendance view.



2. Page elements:

Meeting header: Title, Venue, Start/End times.

Large In button (blue) and Out button (gray).

ID card input box with placeholder: “Place your ID card on the reader”.

Right-side action buttons: View Attendees, End Meeting.



3. Record an IN (participant arrival):

1. Ensure the reader (RFID/Barcode) is connected and working.


2. Click In (optional — the system may default to In mode).


3. Participant places/swipes their ID card on the reader or types card number into the input box.


4. System logs Time In for that participant and displays confirmation (visual or toast).




4. Record an OUT (participant leaves):

1. Click Out (if required by workflow).


2. Participant places/swipes their ID card (or types card ID).


3. System logs Time Out for that participant.




5. End the meeting:

1. After the session finishes, click End Meeting.


2. Confirm when prompted.


3. Result: meeting status set to Completed and further taps are ignored (unless reopened by admin).




6. Expected results:

Each tap stores a timestamp and associates it with the employee record.

If a Time Out is missing, the attendee remains listed as not signed out.




View Attendees / View Meeting Details

1. Access:

On the meeting attendance page, click View Attendees or from Meetings List click eye and then View Attendees.



2. Page elements:

Table columns: #, ID, Name, Department, Time In, Time Out.



3. How to use:

1. Review Time In / Time Out timestamps for each attendee.


2. Use this list to verify who attended and whether they signed out.


3. Export or print (if feature exists) for attendance records.




4. Interpreting the table:

Empty Time Out indicates attendee hasn’t tapped out yet.

Multiple entries per user indicate multiple taps (depending on business rules).



5. Troubleshooting:

If an expected attendee doesn’t appear, verify their card number is registered in the employee database.

If Time In shows wrong time, check server time/timezone settings.




Common Troubleshooting & Tips

Reader not registering cards:

Verify physical connection (USB/COM), reader drivers, and correct reader mode.

Check browser focus: the card input box often needs focus to accept keyboard emulation readers.


“Invalid card” or no employee found:

Ensure employee card is registered and linked to employee ID in the system DB.


Timestamps wrong:

Check server clock and timezone settings.


Cannot End Meeting / Actions disabled:

Check your role/permissions. Admins have more controls.


Accidental deletion:

Verify if your system supports soft delete (trash/recover) — otherwise contact database admin.



Permissions & Roles (quick notes)

Regular users: likely can tap IN/OUT and view attendees.

Organizers/Facilitators: create and edit meetings, open attendance page.

Admins: system maintenance, manage users, delete meetings, and recover records (if available).

-- Update 1244
Perfect — let’s extend your manual to include SSRS (SQL Server Reporting Services) Reporting Tool that mirrors your View Attendees table but pulls directly from the database.

Here’s a clear step-by-step explanation + user manual section you can give to your users.


---

📊 SSRS Reporting Tool – User Manual

🎯 Purpose

The SSRS report is designed to display meeting attendance records similar to the View Attendees page in your app.
It retrieves data from the database, including:

Meeting ID

Employee ID and Name

Department

Time In / Time Out

Created By (the user who created the meeting record)


This report is useful for auditing and exporting official attendance records.


---

🔑 Accessing the Report

1. Open your browser.


2. Go to your SSRS Report Manager URL, usually something like:

http://<server-name>/Reports

or

http://<server-name>/Reports/Pages/Folder.aspx


3. Navigate to the folder where your IT/admin deployed the report (example: MeetingReports).


4. Click on Meeting Attendance Report.




---

🖱 Running the Report

1. When you open the report, you’ll see filter parameters at the top (if configured):

Meeting ID (enter or select a meeting ID, e.g., MA-202509-006).

Date Range (optional — filter meetings within a start and end date).

Created By (optional — select the meeting organizer).



2. Select your filters.


3. Click View Report.

📋 Report Output (Table Layout)

The report generates a table similar to your View Attendees page:

#	Meeting ID	ID	Name	Department	Time In	Time Out	Created By

2	MA-202509-006	002	Juan Dela Cruz	HRD	09-29-2025 10:52 PM	09-29-2025 11:45 PM	AdminUser


Columns explained:

# → Row number (sequential).

Meeting ID → Unique identifier of the meeting.

ID → Employee ID.

Name → Full employee name.

Department → Department of employee.

Time In → Date and time of tap-in.

Time Out → Date and time of tap-out.

Created By → Username of the meeting creator.



---

📤 Exporting the Report

1. After running the report, look at the top-right of the SSRS toolbar.


2. Click the Export dropdown (usually a disk icon or "Save").


3. Choose your format:

Excel (.xlsx) – for further data manipulation.

PDF – for printing/sharing official reports.

Word – if you need editable text.



4. Save the exported file to your computer.




---

🔍 Common Use Cases

HR/Training needs to verify attendance for compliance.

Audit team checks who created the meeting and confirms entries.

Managers export reports for employee evaluations or training records.

Admin compares Meeting ID logs vs System Logs.



---

⚠️ Troubleshooting

No data appears:

Verify the Meeting ID exists.

Check the Date Range filter.


Created By missing:

Confirm your SQL query includes the CreatedBy column from tbl_Meetings.


Export errors:

Try a different format (Excel/PDF).

If still failing, report to IT for SSRS log review.




---

👉 In summary:
This SSRS report acts as the official printable version of your attendance sheet, with the added benefit of tracking who created the meeting.


---

Do you want me to also write the SQL query + SSRS dataset structure that powers this report, so you (or your IT team) can deploy it directly?

-- Update Meeting List 1244
Perfect 👍 we’ll extend your User Manual for the Meeting List page to explain the new row highlight logic.

Here’s the updated manual section (with your condition clearly explained):


---

📖 Meeting Attendance Tapping – User Manual (Extended)

📂 Meetings List Page

The Meetings List page shows all scheduled meetings in a table format. Each row contains details like:

Meeting ID

Title

Start Date / End Date

Venue

Status

Actions (View, Edit, Delete)



---

🎨 Row Highlighting Rules

To help users quickly identify the status of meetings, rows are highlighted with colors:

🔴 Light Red Row →

The meeting’s End Date/Time has already passed

Status = Scheduled (meaning the meeting was not started or properly ended)


🟡 Light Yellow Row →

The meeting’s End Date/Time has already passed

Status = Ongoing (meaning the meeting is still considered active, even though the scheduled time ended)




---

📌 Example

#	Meeting ID	Title	Start Date	End Date	Venue	Status	Row Color

1	MA-202509-006	Training 01	09-30-2025 10:09 pm	09-30-2025 11:09 pm	F1	Scheduled	🔴 Light Red
2	MA-202509-007	Training 02	09-30-2025 1:00 pm	09-30-2025 2:00 pm	F2	Ongoing	🟡 Light Yellow



---

🛠 Actions

From the Actions column:

👁 View – Open the meeting attendance page

✏ Edit – Modify meeting details

🗑 Delete – Remove the meeting



---

👉 This way, users can immediately know which meetings are overdue just by looking at the table.


---

Would you like me to merge this section with the Login → Dashboard → Meetings → Attendance → View Attendees manual I wrote earlier into one full manual document (PDF/Word), so you can distribute it directly to your users?
