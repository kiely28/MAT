Nice — here’s a single, clean step-by-step user manual that walks a user through the whole flow: Login → Dashboard → Meetings List → Meeting Attendance → View Attendees / View Meeting Details. I kept each task short and actionable so you can copy/paste into a help page or print it.

Login (Access the system)

1. Open your browser and navigate to the app URL (example: https://yourserver/login.aspx).


2. On the Login card:

1. Enter your Username.


2. Enter your Password (characters are hidden while typing).


3. (Optional) Click Forgot password? if you need to reset your password.


4. Click Log in.




3. Expected result:

If credentials are valid → you are redirected to the Dashboard.

If invalid → an error message appears (e.g., “Invalid username or password”). Re-enter details or request help from admin.




Dashboard (Summary & navigation)

1. Purpose: quick overview of meetings and their statuses.


2. What you see:

Top navigation: Dashboard, Meetings, System Maintenance, user icon.

Summary cards: Upcoming, Ongoing, Missed, Completed (each shows a count and a View Details link).



3. How to use:

1. Click a summary card’s View Details to open a filtered meetings list for that status.


2. Click Dashboard at any time to return here.




4. Expected result:

Clicking a card or View Details leads to the Meetings page filtered by that status.




Meetings List (view, create, edit, delete)

1. Access: Click Meetings in the top navigation.


2. Page elements:

+ Create New Meeting button (top-left).

Table columns: #, Meeting ID, Title, Start Date, End Date, Venue, Status, Actions (eye/edit/trash icons).



3. Create a new meeting:

1. Click + Create New Meeting.


2. Fill in required fields: Title, Start Date/Time, End Date/Time, Venue, (optional) participant list or notes.


3. Click Save or Create.


4. Expected: system generates a unique Meeting ID and the new meeting appears in the list with status Scheduled.




4. View meeting details:

1. In the table, click the eye icon (View).


2. Expected: opens meeting details page (meeting title, schedule, venue, description, attendees).




5. Edit a meeting:

1. Click the pencil icon.


2. Update fields as needed.


3. Click Save.


4. Note: editing ongoing meetings should be limited—avoid changing start time while session is active.




6. Delete a meeting:

1. Click the trash icon.


2. Confirm the deletion when prompted.


3. Warning: deletion is permanent (unless system implements a soft-delete).




7. Expected behavior & tips:

Status automatically changes depending on current time (Scheduled → Ongoing → Completed) or admin actions (End Meeting).

If you can’t see Create/Edit/Delete options, you likely lack necessary permissions (contact admin).




Meeting Attendance (tap IN / OUT)

1. Access:

From Meetings List, click the eye icon on a meeting, then click Open or the Meeting Attendance view.



2. Page elements:

Meeting header: Title, Venue, Start/End times.

Large In button (blue) and Out button (gray).

ID card input box with placeholder: “Place your ID card on the reader”.

Right-side action buttons: View Attendees, End Meeting.



3. Record an IN (participant arrival):

1. Ensure the reader (RFID/Barcode) is connected and working.


2. Click In (optional — the system may default to In mode).


3. Participant places/swipes their ID card on the reader or types card number into the input box.


4. System logs Time In for that participant and displays confirmation (visual or toast).




4. Record an OUT (participant leaves):

1. Click Out (if required by workflow).


2. Participant places/swipes their ID card (or types card ID).


3. System logs Time Out for that participant.




5. End the meeting:

1. After the session finishes, click End Meeting.


2. Confirm when prompted.


3. Result: meeting status set to Completed and further taps are ignored (unless reopened by admin).




6. Expected results:

Each tap stores a timestamp and associates it with the employee record.

If a Time Out is missing, the attendee remains listed as not signed out.




View Attendees / View Meeting Details

1. Access:

On the meeting attendance page, click View Attendees or from Meetings List click eye and then View Attendees.



2. Page elements:

Table columns: #, ID, Name, Department, Time In, Time Out.



3. How to use:

1. Review Time In / Time Out timestamps for each attendee.


2. Use this list to verify who attended and whether they signed out.


3. Export or print (if feature exists) for attendance records.




4. Interpreting the table:

Empty Time Out indicates attendee hasn’t tapped out yet.

Multiple entries per user indicate multiple taps (depending on business rules).



5. Troubleshooting:

If an expected attendee doesn’t appear, verify their card number is registered in the employee database.

If Time In shows wrong time, check server time/timezone settings.




Common Troubleshooting & Tips

Reader not registering cards:

Verify physical connection (USB/COM), reader drivers, and correct reader mode.

Check browser focus: the card input box often needs focus to accept keyboard emulation readers.


“Invalid card” or no employee found:

Ensure employee card is registered and linked to employee ID in the system DB.


Timestamps wrong:

Check server clock and timezone settings.


Cannot End Meeting / Actions disabled:

Check your role/permissions. Admins have more controls.


Accidental deletion:

Verify if your system supports soft delete (trash/recover) — otherwise contact database admin.



Permissions & Roles (quick notes)

Regular users: likely can tap IN/OUT and view attendees.

Organizers/Facilitators: create and edit meetings, open attendance page.

Admins: system maintenance, manage users, delete meetings, and recover records (if available).
