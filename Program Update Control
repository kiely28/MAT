Sure üëç Here‚Äôs a simple and clear description and purpose for each of your WinActor modules:


---

üß© Module 1: KP26.ums7

Description:
This module automates the SAP transaction KP26 (Activity Type Planning: Price Calculation).

Purpose:

To automatically input or update activity rate values (e.g., OHG Coefficients, Labor Rates, Machine Rates) for each cost center in SAP.

It retrieves data (like cost center codes and calculated rates) from a prepared Excel file and inputs them into the KP26 transaction.

Ensures accuracy and saves time by automating repetitive data entry and validation tasks in SAP.



---

üß© Module 2: S_ALR.ums7

Description:
This module automates the SAP report generation transaction (S_ALR...), typically used for cost center reports or financial summaries.

Purpose:

To automatically execute and extract reports from SAP using the S_ALR transaction (e.g., S_ALR_87013611 ‚Äì Cost Centers: Actual/Plan/Variance).

It can download the report output (e.g., Excel or PDF) as a reference or proof document.

Often used after KP26 updates to verify or validate the correctness of uploaded values.

Perfect üëç here‚Äôs a clear and professional description and purpose for your coefficient.exe ‚Äî your centralized app UI:


---

üñ•Ô∏è File: coefficient.exe

Description:
coefficient.exe is the centralized application interface (UI) that serves as the main control hub for executing automation scenarios.
It provides an easy-to-use graphical interface where users can select and run automation modules such as KP26.ums7 and S_ALR.ums7 without manually opening WinActor or SAP.
The app handles process launching, parameter passing, and status display during automation runs.


---

Purpose:

To act as the main entry point for all SAP automation activities.

To allow users to choose automation scenarios (e.g., KP26 update or report generation) through simple buttons.

To trigger WinActor automation scripts automatically and pass necessary data (like fiscal year, month, or file path).

To monitor and log process completion, errors, and outputs.

To ensure a standardized and user-friendly way of controlling automation workflows.

As a countermeasure, the system includes validation and error-checking functions to ensure data accuracy and reliability during automation.

The program improves process efficiency, minimizes human error, and saves time by automating the OHG Coefficient input in SAP.

The purpose of the program is to automate the OHG Coefficient input process in SAP using WinActor to ensure accuracy, efficiency, and reduced manual effort by Procurement.

On a quarterly basis, Procurement inputs the OHG Coefficient into SAP using reference values from Business Control to ensure accurate cost center data that directly impacts company product pricing.

---

The OHG Coefficient input process is performed quarterly in SAP by Procurement based on Business Control‚Äôs reference values, ensuring accurate cost center data that influences company pricing.
